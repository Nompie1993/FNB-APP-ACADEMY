                        <h3>KOALAS</h3>
<p>Koalas are marsupials native to Australia, known for their tree-dwelling habits and eucalyptus diet. They are often recognized for their large, round faces and fluffy ears.</p>
<p>Koalas are primarily nocturnal and spend most of their time sleeping in eucalyptus trees. They have a specialized diet, feeding almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most other animals. Koalas have a unique digestive system that allows them to detoxify the chemicals in the leaves.</p>  
  <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
  <p>You will find the koalas next to the giraffe enclosure.</p>
