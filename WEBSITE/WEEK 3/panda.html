                        <h3>PANDAS</h3>     
<p>Pandas are large, bear-like mammals native to China, known for their distinctive black and white fur. They primarily inhabit bamboo forests in the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>Pandas are primarily herbivorous, with bamboo making up about 99% of their diet. They have a unique digestive system that allows them to extract nutrients from bamboo, although they still need to consume large quantities to meet their energy needs. Pandas are known for their playful behavior and are often seen climbing trees or rolling around in the grass.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
<p>You will find the panda enclosure at the Panda Canyon.</p>
