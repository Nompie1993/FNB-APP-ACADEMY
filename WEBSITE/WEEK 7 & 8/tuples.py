#tuples 

# Tuples are immutable sequences in Python, meaning they cannot be changed after creation.
# They are defined using parentheses and can contain any data type.
# Example of creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4,5)   
print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)     
# Accessing elements in a tuple
print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1      
print(my_tuple[1])  # Output: 2

print(my_tuple[-2])  # Output: 3
