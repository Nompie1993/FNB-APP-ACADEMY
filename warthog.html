                        <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
<p>Warthogs are wild pigs native to Africa, known for their distinctive tusks and rugged appearance. They are typically found in savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Although covered in bristly hairs, their bodies and heads appear largely naked from a distance, with only the crest along the back, and the tufts on their cheeks and tails being obviously haired. The English name refers to their facial wattles, which are particularly distinct in males. They also have very distinct tusks, which reach a length of 25.5 to 63.5 cm (10.0 to 25.0 in) in the males, but are always smaller in the females. They are largely herbivorous, but occasionally also eat small animal food. While both species remain fairly common and widespread, and therefore are considered to be of Least Concern by the IUCN, the nominate subspecies of the desert warthog, commonly known as the Cape warthog, became extinct around 1865.</p>
<P><strong>You will find the warthogs at WA11, near the elephant enclosure.</strong></p>
